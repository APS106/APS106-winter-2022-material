    "## 1. Defining Your Own Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "From the last lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of a function definition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_body(parameters):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    DOCSTRING\n",
    "    This is what my function does.\n",
    "    This is what the parameters are.\n",
    "    This is what the function returns.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"This is where you code goes to do the thing that the function does\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return \"This is where you return what the function returns\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def` is a keyword, standing for \"definition\". All function definitions must begin with `def`. The `def` statement must end with a colon.\n",
    "- `function_name` is the name you will use to call the function (like `sin`, `abs` but you need to create your own name)\n",
    "- `parameters` are the variables that get values when you call the function. You can have 0 or more parameters, separated by commas. Must be in parenthesis.\n",
    "- `body` is a sequence of commands like we've already seen (assignment, multiplication, function calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: all the lines of `body` must be indented. That is how Python knows that they are part of the function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you need to repeatedly take the absolute value of a number, round-up, divide by 2, and round down. You can do this using by chaining together functions."

    "## 2. Design Recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a function you should consider six main steps in a function design recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Six Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Examples**\n",
    "    - What should your function do?\n",
    "    - Create a couple of example calls.\n",
    "    - Pick a meaningful name (often a verb or verb phrase): What is a short answer to \"What does your function do\"?\n",
    "2. **Type Contract: define your arguments and their types (int, float, str, ...)**\n",
    "    - What are the arguments types?\n",
    "    - What type of value is returned?\n",
    "3. **Header: write the `def` line of your function**\n",
    "    - Pick meaningful argument names. Don’t just use x or y – it is much easier to understand a function if the variables have names that reflect their meaning.\n",
    "4. **Description**\n",
    "    - Write a docstring describing of the function in the code. Mention every argument in your description. (Wait, what is a docstring? Stay tuned.)\n",
    "    - Describe the return value.\n",
    "1. **Body**\n",
    "    - Write the body of your function.\n",
    "6. **Test**\n",
    "    - Run the examples you designed in Step 1 to make sure they work as expected.\n",

If a programmer has to understand every line of code (and how it relates to every other line of code), Google would be impossible. However, let's imagine that Google has created a function called `search` which takes a string and returns the top 10 results of a Google search. This function will call other functions which call other functions, etc.; probably totalling hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code. But if you are responsible for part of Google Maps and something in Google Maps requires you to do an internet search, you can just call the `search` function!

    "2. **Define Test Cases.** Create some examples that reflect your code solving the problem: input and output. \n",

These two plans are not the same thing! If the hardest part of your algorithm plan is late in the sequence, you may still choose to code it first to figure out how to do it. (Figuring it out may change other parts of your algorithm plan!).\n",
    "4. **Select a Solution.** Based on the different algorithm and programming plans, decide which is the most promising.\n",
    "5. **Implement the Solution.** Start to execute your programming plan. Test as you go! You may realize that your algorithm plan doesn't solve the problem, or even that you do not understand the problem. If so, go back to earlier steps.\n",
