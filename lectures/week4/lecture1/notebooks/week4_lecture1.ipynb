    "**[Comment for more advanced programmers]** Those of you who know some programming may be asking \"why don't we just use a for-loop?\". That is a good question and one answer is that we wanted to introduce while-loops first. Anotehr answer is that for the first few examples (e.g., print the first 5 perfect squares) you probably would use a for-loop. But once we wanted to print out all the squares less than some value, we no longer know how many times we want to loop. We want to loop until some condition is false - and this is exactly what while-loops are for."
