    "\n",
    "You just finished your APS106 midterm and heading to dinner with a few friends. However, no one can decide what to eat. Recently, your friends have been watching the Big Bang Theory and are planning on using Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to truly make the game fun, you will be playing each other! The person with the best record in this round-robin tournament will decide what to eat. Thus, write a Python program that using conditional statements and two user inputs to play Rock-Paper-Lizard-Spock against your friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you are hungry! Make sure your code is efficient, well-thought-out, and accounts for all possibilities.\n",

    "Given the spin on the classic rock-paper-scissors-game, we must develop a Python program with two user inputs, conditional statements, that obeys the game's rules, and accounts for all possible scenarios to be as comprehensive as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty in this problem lies in the implementation of the game with the comparison of user inputs. Do we want to use many if-statements? Is there a simpler way to do it? Let's consider some test cases first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that: 1) we are doing this AFTER our APS106 midterm so #cleancode is fresh in our mind; and most importantly, 2) we are starving."
