    "If you want to buy a house, you need to find houses that are for sale. The multiple listing service (MLS) is a real estate listings service in Toronto that is updated throughout the day with new listings. The service has limited capabilities with housing listed by district, rather than particular streets. It would be much more convenient for the user to be able to input a list of streets and see all the houses for sale on those streets. Your goal is to take the current listings and create such an app. "

    "* Get the user input and store it somehow\n",
    "* For each street entered, find houses on the street\n",
    "* Print-out the address, size, and price of each house found\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step and the last two steps will probably be related since the way we store the MLS data is going to determine what we have to do to find the houses on a given street and what we need to do to print out the information on each house. The fundamental question is how to represent the MLS data so that we can efficiently search for street names and then print out the data from the houses no that street. We've studied a number of data structures: lists? nested lists? tuples? sets? dictionaries?\n",

    "It is not clear right now what the best options are. We could tackle this problem immediately but it seems hard. Sometimes it is better to do the steps that seem easier first to get them out of the way (and in the meantime we can let the hard problem sit in the back of our heads).\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's my proposed Programming Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement code to get the user input and store it somehow (i.e., Algorithm Plan Step 2)\n",
    "1. Read the CSV file.\n",
    "1.\tDesign data structure for the MLS data.\n",
    "1.\tConvert the data read from the CSV file to our data structure. Or maybe go back to Step 2 and directly put the data into our data structure while reading it.\n",
    "1.\tImplement the searching for houses on a street\n",
    "1.\tImplement the output of the data for the houses found\n",
