    "If you want to buy a house, you need to find houses that are for sale. The multiple listing service (MLS) is a real estate listings service in Toronto that is updated throughout the day with new listings. The service has limited capabilities with housing listed by district, rather than particular streets. It would be much more convenient for the user to be able to input a list of streets and see all the houses for sale on those streets. Your goal is to take the current listings and create such an app. "

    "The first step and the last two steps will probably be related since the way we store the MLS data is going to determine what we have to do to find the houses on a given street and what we need to do to print out the information on each house. The fundamental question is how to represent the MLS data so that we can efficiently search for street names and then print out the data from the houses no that street. We've studied a number of data structures: lists? nested lists? tuples? sets? dictionaries?\n",
