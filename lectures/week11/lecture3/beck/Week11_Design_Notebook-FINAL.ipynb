Gaussian Elimination is pretty straightforward and you likely studied it in high school, so let's choose that method. Note that such a choice changes the problem definition from writing code to solve a system of equations to writing code that implements Gaussian Elimination. This is a big step since you don't have to re-invent Gaussian Elimination -- we can just look up the method.\n",
