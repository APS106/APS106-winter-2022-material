    "A lot of introductory problems in this course can be seen as impractical due to their lack of application to everyday life. Here, we try to show how, using real world data, coding can be fun! In many data-focused jobs or applications, CSV files are used to store large matrices and sets of data. In these files, each column generally represents a piece of data. Here, we are looking at data from the National Hockey League (NHL) that contains the past head-to-head (H2H) information of teams since the beginning of the league (with modified names). But, we are not interested in ANY team - we are interested in the best hockey team of all time: the Toronto Maple Leafs. Your goal is to read this data file containing the Leafs' H2H record against other teams and be able to make an application where search for a team  and determine their head-to-head record and information regarding these match ups that are also contained in the CSV file."
